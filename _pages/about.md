A bit about myself
----

I am a senior NLP scientist at Aon IPS with 13 years of experience in Data Science and Software Engineering, who loves to work on exciting projects with awesome people. In the past, I worked for a number of start-ups as a Data Scientist and a Software Engineer, and was a CTO of a boutique ML company. My research is in Machine Learning and NLP with work in deep learning and authorship verification published and under review in top-5 conferences. I attended the University of Texas in Austin and the University of Houstonwith a PhD in Computer Science with a focus on AI and a dissertation on "Domain Adaptation using Deep Adversarial Models". 

Outside of professional life, my main passion is travel, which I think can be attributed to learning something new each time I place myself in new environments and cultures. My other hobbies include biking, surfing, reading, spending time with friends and making new ones.
