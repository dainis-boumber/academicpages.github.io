Excerpt
---
We propose a Maximum a Posteriori approach to
estimate model complexity in supervised learning by assuming
the existence of a previous learning task from which we can
build a prior distribution. Our method is embedded in a domain-
adaptation scenario, where the goal is to learn a model on
a target task characterized by a shortage of class labels; this
difficulty is commonly tackled by exploiting information from
a similar source task where there is an abundance of examples
and class labels. In contrast to previous work, our approach
does not rely on the proximity of source and target distributions.
Instead we simply assume a strong similarity in model complexity
across tasks, and use active learning to mitigate the dependency
on source examples. Our work leads to a new formulation
for the likelihood as a function of empirical error using a
theoretical learning bound; the result is a novel mapping from
generalization error to a likelihood estimation.
