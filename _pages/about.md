Hi, welcome to my (under construction) website!
----

Here you can find information about me and some of my current and future work; as I have more time, it will be updated with thoughts on various (mostly machine learning related) topics, and a number of other things such as tutorials, links to resources I find useful, my white papers, and more.

A bit about myself
----

I am a senior data scientist and a CTO with 11 years of experience in Data Science and Software Engineering who loves to work on exciting projects with awesome people. I have expert-level skills in Tensorflow, scikit-learn, Python, fastai, Keras and other tools. I'm also an active researcher in Machine Learning and NLP with work in deep learning and authorship verification published and under review in top-5 conferences. I attended the University of Texas in Austin and the University of Houston. I have a PhD in CS with the dissertation on "Domain Adaptation using Deep Adversarial Models". Outside of professional life, my main passion is travel, which I think can be attributed to learning something new each time I place myself in new environments and cultures. My other hobbies include biking, surfing, reading, spending time with friends and making new ones.
