Excerpt
---
In this paper we propose a new general approach to domain
adaptation that does not rely on the proximity of source and
target distributions. Instead we simply assume a strong similarity
in model complexity across domains, and use active learning to
mitigate the dependency on source examples. Our work leads to a
new formulation for the likelihood as a function of empirical error
using a theoretical learning bound; the result is a novel mapping
from generalization error to a likelihood estimation.
