Technical and Management Experience
======
* SnapRapid: Researched, designed, developed and delivered solutions that use AI/Machine Learning to estimate potential influence of social media accounts featuring multi-media content. Used NLP to determine their relevance, skill set, and the role account author plays in the industry. Used in a recommendation engine.
* AI-Savvy: Responsible for Solution Architecture, Data Science, Business Development, and delivery of product. Managed a technical team of 10, 2 PhDs and 3 MS Data Scientists core data science team. External interaction with CEOs and CTOs.
* AE Studio: Researched and developed solutions for clients who needed Visual QA and Visual Dialogue. Used Image Recognition, NLP and Deep Learning to help achieve their goals. 
* Pattern Analysis Laboratory: Dissertation in Domain Adaptation using Deep Adversarial Models, research in Machine Learning and NLP. Worked on applied and research projects for oil & gas and NASA.
* I2C Laboratory: Worked with the director of Cyber Security Division of HSARPA. Managed team of 7 employees on a $1 million project that improved mobile device’s security by detecting is the person using it is not the owner based on previous patterns. Worked as a data scientist  to prevent DDoS attacks on 911 emergency telecommunication channels. Both projects were funded by the DHS. 
* Software Engineer, DomainSpa Inc. Designed and implemented applications and tools for a domain registrar. Co-authored a meta-search engine.
* HRL Laboratories: SEAndroid/SELinux kernel modification project for the GM. CloudCOP - Distributed Cloud Cryptography Project for the NSA. Responsible for network stack and parallelism. 
* Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL): Worked on development of chatbot software to be used for in-house tech support management.
